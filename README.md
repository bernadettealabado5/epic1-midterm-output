# The Circlemation

I call this pattern "The Circlemation" because there were many circles that I've input into my code and it was really my goal to put a lot of circles onto it.
I chose and created this Mandala Pattern without really expecting that it will turn out like this because I just made a lot of trial and errors until I get satisfied with my work.

I watched some tutorials in youtube and tried to learn how they code for their patterns and as what I have mentioned, I was inspired to make a pattern that uses a lot of circles and form it into a flower but then due to many updates that I've done to my code, my pattern ended up like this and I am happy with the results.
